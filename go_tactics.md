# Go Tactics Explained: Modern Insights

## 1. Direction of Play
- Play away from strength, toward the largest open areas.
- Avoid small moves early; prioritize corners, then sides, then center.
- Example: Opening on the 4-4 point (star point) gives flexibility and influence.

## 2. Shape and Efficiency
- Good shape (ponnuki, bamboo joint) is strong and flexible.
- Avoid bad shape (empty triangle, overconcentration).
- Example: A ponnuki (diamond of four stones) is worth 30 points!

## 3. Joseki and Fuseki
- Learn common corner patterns (joseki) and whole-board openings (fuseki).
- Don’t memorize blindly—understand the purpose behind each move.
- Example: The 3-4 point leads to fast development, but can be invaded.

## 4. Life and Death
- Groups need two eyes to live. Always read out life and death for your groups and your opponent’s.
- Example: Don’t play moves that put your own stones in self-atari (one liberty left).

## 5. Thickness and Influence
- Use strong positions (thickness) to attack or build territory elsewhere.
- Don’t make territory near your own thickness—expand your influence.

## 6. Invasion and Reduction
- Invade large frameworks before they become solid territory.
- Reduce from the outside if invasion is too dangerous.

## 7. Ko Fights
- Ko is a repeated capture situation. Use ko threats to win important kos.
- Example: Don’t ignore a ko threat if it could cost you a large group.

## 8. Endgame
- In the endgame, count points and play the largest moves first.
- Don’t waste moves filling your own territory.

## 9. Learn from Pro Games
- Study professional games to see how these principles are applied in real play.
- Try to understand the reasoning behind each move, not just the sequence.
